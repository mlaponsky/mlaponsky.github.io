Welcome! I'm Max Laponsky, a data scientist from Washington, DC. In my day job, I focus on applying natural language processing techniques to healthcare problems and building deployable data infrastructure and analytics pipelines.

This blog is my journal, working through novel NLP and analytics projects that I've stumbeld across in my spare time. I've got a particular passion for music and basketball, and have been toying with data in bot of those spheres for some time. In the future, who knows what projects my latest obsession will take me towards.

If you want to take a look at my projects, feel free to check out my [GitHub page](http://github.com/mlaponsky). If you want to get in touch, [shoot me an email](mailto:thebiglaponsky@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
